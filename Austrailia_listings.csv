I am privileged to have traveled to many corners of the globe, including, Africa, USA, Canada, Europe, UK, the Pacific, NZ, Australia, South America and Asia.

Love exchanging travel stories, ideas and meeting people of different cultures. My purpose for traveling is to experience varying cultures, hopefully improve my tolerance, knowledge and grow as an individual from the experience and fortunate to have volunteered in Brazil and South Africa

The house","Welcome to Little George, a light-filled 3 level home in vibrant Fitzroy filled with comfy furnishings and vintage touches.   With Fitzroy's almost 100 cafes, restaurants, live music venues, cocktail bars and pubs you have chosen a wonderful area to stay in.  This is an award winning Kerstin Thompson house and has been my home for 16 years.  I love living here - I hope you'll enjoy visiting, it's nice to have you! Hi there, This listing is for one bedroom on the ground floor of my large 3 level home just off the wonderful Gertrude Street. (I have 2 rooms available - the other listing is 'Stunning Fitzroy own level+ensuite' listing #72576). ***Please not I only have 1 parking permit so please check it is available before booking, it usually is but it's definitely worth checking*** This is an excellent spot for guests in Melbourne for a short time who want that 'local feeling'.

Right next to the city with both the Fitzroy and Carlton gardens in between, it's never boring but very relaxed.  If on the odd occasion it's noisy there are ear plugs in your bedside tables. Diversity, cafes, boutiques, galleries, pubs, parks, restaurants, cocktail bars, music, street art = good vibes.","Please note the bed (an extremely comfortable queen) is against the wall on one side. It's a good idea to check Melbourne's weather report before you arrive, we really can have ""all seasons in 1 day"" so it's wise to bring something warm even for those summer nights.  I recommend the app 'Weatherzone'.  Help yourself to the umbrellas at the bottom of the stairs! Optus reception is not great in this room but other networks are good.","There is so much to offer in Fitzroy you could spend most of your time getting around on foot.  I've left a local guide and map in your room and marked a square around the main Fitzroy streets as a start.

Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away.

My wife Stacey and I have some amazing places in Melbourne and the Yarra Valley that we'd love to share with you. 

We have a stunning (circa 1854) converted stables in St Kilda, which is very close to Fitzroy and Acland Streets, the beach and many awesome cafes and restaurants and the Albert Park Formula One circuit. We have two stunning Art Deco apartments in the Botanic Garden’s precinct in Melbourne, which are close to the best of everything that Melbourne is famous for – shopping with Chapel St (South Yarra), Toorak Rd (South Yarra) & Bridge Rd (Richmond) all within walking distance to the best sports grounds in Australia including the MCG, Australian Open Tennis Arena, Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix and CBD all within 2 klms. South Yarra and the CBD have many of the best bars and restaurants and in typical Melbourne style you’ll have to scour the backstreets and laneways to find them.

Healesville Country House is our beautiful 5 bedroom home in the Yarra Valley, it is a former guesthouse circa 1900 that we've lovingly restored and created a family home from. We are two minutes from the main street and 5-10 minutes from some of the world's best wineries. It is the perfect place for unwinding with plenty of outdoor spaces including a pool and verandahs boasting some of the best views around.

Check out our profile for additional information and pictures. We're really happy to recommend our favourite restaurants, cafes and places to see. 
  
About us - I’m work with the best and brightest Australian technology and digital start-ups to help them become successful through investment and mentoring. Stacey is in the Fashion Industry and travels the world promoting emerging Australian brands to the rest of the world.

An exciting area with a focus on the visual and performing arts, food, fashion and independant retail. It takes about five/ten minutes to walk to the city and is close to the major hospitals and universities, Melbourne Museum and the Exhibition Building. Twenty minute walk to the Victoria Market, or a tram ride. Thirty minutes to Collingwood Children's Farm and artist's/farmer's markets. Much has been said of Brunswick St, running down the middle of Fitzroy and it's unique atmosphere and galleries, venues, bars and cafes. Gertrude St was the first block outside the city to be sub-divided and has many bluestone buildings from the 1860's that now house quirky be-spoke designer makers and ""stand alone"" retailers ...from men's hats at SMART, Alec to organic bread at Fatto a Mano.

The Nicholson St tram, number 96 takes you all the way to St. Kilda. Two minutes walk to Victoria Parade trams and buses.  Five minute walk to Johnston St buses. If you are driving we have on street parking,so it is sometimes difficult to find a spot. Better to use the many forms of public transport around us. A cab to the airport takes between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the traffic. Or catch a tram into the city and the airport bus from there. To get to Southern Cross Station (Spencer st station) take the Smith/Gertrude St tram number 86.","You will have the whole house to yourselves and your entrance is separate from ours.

I would like to dispel the myths of current medical thinking and inspire our systems to work on the cause rather than just the symptoms. Preventative medicine is not just about screening physical bodies but need to address underlying dis-ease ( lack of ease) in our emotions, mind and spirit).
